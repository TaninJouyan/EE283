#### Homework week 2: Symlinks

The purpose of this week's homework was to create symlinks to raw datas, and store and rename them for future use. Three different data from DNAseq, RNAseq and ATACseq experiments were used. 

Symlink script pathways:
[DNAseq data](code/scripts/DNAsymlink.sh)
[ATACseq data](code/scripts/ATACsymlink.sh)
[RNAseq data](code/scripts/RNAsymlink.sh)

All symlinks has been stored in `data/raw` directory.
