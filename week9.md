#### Week 9 

In this weeks assignment, material was focused on creating plots and plot grids.

**Fixing and 'flights' grid plot**

The following plot is the result of fixing and twiking the assigned plot to make it publishable.

**Creating grid plot from RNA analysis plots**
**Manhattan Plot**
The data retrieved from week 8 was used to plot manhattan plots shown below. 

1) Using ggplot to create the plots for two ANOVA models

''' R
model1 <- anova(lm(asin(sqrt(freq)) ~ treat + founder + treat:founder, data=mal2))
model2 <- anova(lm(asin(sqrt(freq)) ~ founder + treat %in% founder, data=mal2))
'''

2) The 'myManhattan.R' script has been used to generate the following plots
 For this problem two manhattan plots were generated using the same data used in the previous section. In addittion, a scatter plot is showing the th SNPs that are called differently between the two models.
